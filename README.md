# https://freemodoro.vercel.app/

Freemodoro is a Pomodoro timer that gives you both freedom and discipline in setting your work & rest times! 

- instead of a timer, a stopwatch
- instead of forcing you to stop working, toggle anytime you feel like it to switch to break
- minutes of break is calculated proportionally (work : break = 5:1, 25:5)
- so your deep work and flow will not be interrupted
- so you will not take overtime breaks
